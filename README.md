### Hi there üëã

I'm Samir, a Senior Supply Chain Engineer based in Paris. I have developped a passion of using Data Science and Python programming to optimize Supply Chain operations. 

Have a look at my blog [http://samirsaci.com](https://samirsaci.com) to find articles regarding Data Science for Warehousingüì¶, Transportation üöö and Demand Forecasting üìà.
